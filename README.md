# Drawing-Platform

It's a physical device that lets a user draw a sketch of their choice on p5.js and replicate it physically using a polar coordinate pen (plotter). In essence, the user can interact and control the device using a sketch as simple as an Archimedean spiral or as complex as a zine design of an engineering creation. It boils down to the user’s choice. Besides, the interconnectivity of the sketch, inspired by the Eulerian trial, adds to the artistic element of the system. 

The system comprises of a bunch of mechanical components and electrical motors that complement the functionality of the device. The device is based on a 2-DOF system in which the plotter moves to and fro on a linear rail, while the bottom plate follows the rotational motion orthogonal to the linear rail. The movement of the base plate facilitates a variety of designs, thus allowing the user to sketch any form of drawing.
